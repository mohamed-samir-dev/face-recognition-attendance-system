# Attendance Restriction Implementation Guide

## üîí Overview

The facial recognition attendance system has been configured to ensure that **only the logged-in account holder can mark attendance**. This prevents unauthorized users from marking attendance on behalf of others.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. User Session Validation
- Users must be logged in to access the camera page
- Session is validated before any attendance operations
- Automatic redirect to login if session is invalid

### 2. User-Specific Image Matching
- System fetches **only** the logged-in user's image from Firebase using their numeric ID
- Captured face is compared **exclusively** with that specific user's stored photo
- No access to any other user's images in the database
- Rejects any face that doesn't match the account holder's stored image

### 3. Multi-Layer Validation
- **Frontend**: User session check and face comparison
- **Backend**: Mandatory user validation in API endpoints
- **Database**: Dual comparison (Firebase + local model)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Frontend Restriction (`useAttendance.ts`)
```typescript
// Only use authenticated user from session
const currentUser = user; // Not any previously recognized user

// Compare with logged-in user's photo only
const matchedUser = await compareWithSpecificUser(imageData, currentUser.numericId);

// Show access denied for unauthorized faces
if (!matchedUser) {
  setError(`Only ${expectedName} can mark attendance on this account`);
}
```

### Backend Security (`face_routes.py`)
```python
# Mandatory user validation
expected_user = data.get('expected_user')
if not expected_user:
    return jsonify({'error': 'Expected user must be specified'}), 400

# Validate against expected user only
name, message = face_model.recognize_face(temp_path, expected_user)
```

### Photo Comparison Service
```typescript
// SECURITY: Compare captured image with specific user's Firebase photo ONLY
export async function compareWithSpecificUser(capturedImageData: string, numericId: number)

// Backend fetches image using: WHERE numericId == logged_in_user_id
// Uses face_recognition library with 0.6 threshold for accuracy
const match = distance < threshold;
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User Login**: Employee logs into their account
2. **Session Creation**: System stores user session with their ID
3. **Camera Access**: Only logged-in users can access camera page
4. **Face Capture**: System captures face image from camera
5. **Image Retrieval**: System fetches ONLY the logged-in user's image from Firebase using their numeric ID
6. **Identity Validation**: Compares captured face exclusively with that user's stored photo
7. **Attendance Decision**: 
   - ‚úÖ **Match**: Attendance marked successfully
   - ‚ùå **No Match**: Access denied with clear error message

## üì± User Experience

### Successful Attendance
- Face matches logged-in user ‚Üí Attendance marked
- Shows welcome message with user details
- Records attendance in database

### Unauthorized Attempt
- Face doesn't match ‚Üí "Access Denied - Account Holder Only"
- Clear error message explaining restriction
- Multiple failed attempts ‚Üí Redirect to login

## üß™ Testing the Restriction

Run the test script to verify the system:
```bash
python test_attendance_restriction.py
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Login with User A's account
2. Try to mark attendance with User B's face
3. System should reject and show access denied
4. Try with User A's face ‚Üí Should succeed

## üîç Monitoring & Logging

The system logs all attendance attempts:
- Successful validations
- Unauthorized attempts
- User session information
- Face comparison results

Check browser console for detailed logs during testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Threshold Settings
- **Face Recognition Threshold**: 0.6 (balanced accuracy)
- **Attempt Limit**: 3 failed attempts before lockout
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic redirect to login

### Error Messages
- Clear, user-friendly messages
- No technical details exposed to users
- Specific guidance for resolution

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"User session not found"**: User needs to login again
2. **"Access denied"**: Wrong person trying to mark attendance
3. **"No face detected"**: Improve lighting or camera position
4. **"Multiple faces"**: Ensure only one person in frame

### System Requirements
- Both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5001) must be running
- Camera permissions enabled
- Good lighting for face detection
- User must have photo stored in Firebase

## üìã Summary

‚úÖ **Implemented Features:**
- User session validation
- Face-to-account matching
- Multi-layer security validation
- Clear error messages
- Attempt limiting
- Automatic session management

‚úÖ **Security Benefits:**
- Prevents attendance fraud
- Ensures only account holders can mark attendance
- No access to other users' images in Firebase
- User-specific image retrieval by numeric ID
- Maintains audit trail
- Protects against unauthorized access

The system now successfully restricts attendance marking to only the logged-in account holder, providing a secure and reliable attendance management solution.
