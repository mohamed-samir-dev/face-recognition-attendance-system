# User Restriction Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of user restriction in the face recognition attendance system. The system now only accepts images from the page owner (logged-in user) and rejects any other faces.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Changes (`backend/app/routes/face_routes.py`)
- **Modified `/recognize` endpoint** to accept an optional `expected_user` parameter
- **Added validation** to ensure the recognized face matches the expected user
- **Enhanced security** by preventing unauthorized face recognition

### 2. AI Model Changes (`ai/face_recognition_model.py`)
- **Updated `recognize_face()` method** to accept an optional `expected_user` parameter
- **Added user validation** before Firebase verification
- **Improved access control** at the model level

### 3. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/hooks/attendance/useAttendance.ts`)
- **Modified attendance processing** to pass the expected user to the recognition API
- **Enhanced error messages** to provide clearer feedback when wrong user is detected
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing photo comparison service

## How It Works

### Before (Vulnerable)
```
1. User captures image
2. System recognizes ANY trained face
3. Grants access to anyone in the database
```

### After (Secure)
```
1. User captures image
2. System checks if recognized face matches logged-in user
3. Only grants access to the correct user
4. Rejects all other faces with clear error message
```

## API Usage

### New `/recognize` Endpoint
```json
POST /recognize
{
  "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ...",
  "expected_user": "john_doe"  // Optional but recommended
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "name": "john_doe",
  "message": "Welcome, john_doe. Identity verified successfully."
}
```

**Response (Wrong User):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied. Expected john_doe but detected jane_smith"
}
```

## Security Features

1. **User Context Validation**: Only accepts the expected user's face
2. **Multi-layer Security**: 
   - Photo comparison service (primary)
   - Face recognition API (fallback with validation)
   - Firebase verification (additional layer)
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Users know exactly why access was denied
4. **Backward Compatibility**: System still works without expected_user parameter

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
python test_user_restriction.py
```

The test will verify:
- ✅ Correct user is accepted
- ✅ Wrong user is rejected  
- ✅ Legacy mode still works

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized access
2. **User-Specific Access**: Each user can only mark their own attendance
3. **Clear Feedback**: Users understand why access was denied
4. **Maintains Performance**: No significant impact on recognition speed
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system automatically:
- Uses the logged-in user's information for validation
- Falls back to general recognition if no expected user is provided
- Maintains all existing security layers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Access denied" message**: User is trying to use someone else's account
2. **"Unknown Person"**: Face not in training database
3. **"No face detected"**: Image quality or lighting issues

### Solutions:
1. Ensure user is logged into their own account
2. Verify user's photos are in the training dataset
3. Improve lighting and camera positioning
