# Daily Attendance Restriction Implementation

## Overview
This implementation prevents employees from taking attendance more than once per day. The system integrates with Firebase to track daily attendance records and provides appropriate feedback when attendance has already been taken.

## Key Features
- **One attendance per day**: Employees can only mark attendance once per calendar day
- **Firebase integration**: Attendance records are stored and checked in Firebase Firestore
- **Dual validation**: Both backend and frontend validate attendance status
- **User-friendly feedback**: Clear messages when attendance is already taken
- **Timer integration**: Work timer only starts on successful first attendance

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Firebase Service (`backend/app/services/firebase_service.py`)
- Added `check_daily_attendance()` method to verify if employee has attendance for current date
- Added `record_attendance()` method to store attendance records in Firebase
- Uses date-based queries to check existing attendance

#### 2. Face Recognition Routes (`backend/app/routes/face_routes.py`)
- Modified `/recognize` endpoint to check attendance before processing
- Modified `/compare` endpoint to include attendance validation
- Returns specific error messages when attendance already exists

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Daily Attendance Service (`frontend/src/lib/services/dailyAttendanceService.ts`)
- `checkDailyAttendance()`: Queries Firebase for existing attendance
- `recordDailyAttendance()`: Creates new attendance record in Firebase
- Handles date formatting and error cases

#### 2. Photo Comparison Service (`frontend/src/lib/services/photoComparisonService.ts`)
- Updated to pass employee ID to backend for attendance checking
- Handles attendance-related error responses
- Throws specific errors for attendance already taken

#### 3. Attendance Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/attendance/useAttendance.ts`)
- Added pre-check for daily attendance before face recognition
- Records attendance in Firebase on successful verification
- Handles attendance already taken errors with appropriate UI feedback

#### 4. Employee Info Display (`frontend/src/components/camera/components/EmployeeInfoDisplay.tsx`)
- Special handling for attendance already taken case
- Shows error toast and modal for blocked attendance
- Redirects to dashboard with appropriate messaging

## Data Structure

### Firebase Attendance Collection
```javascript
{
  userId: string,           // Employee ID
  employeeName: string,     // Employee name
  date: string,            // YYYY-MM-DD format
  checkIn: string,         // HH:MM:SS format
  status: 'Present',       // Attendance status
  timestamp: Date          // Full timestamp
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Employee accesses camera**: System checks if attendance already taken
2. **First attempt**: If no attendance exists, proceeds with face recognition
3. **Face verified**: Records attendance and starts work timer
4. **Subsequent attempts**: Shows "already taken" message and blocks process
5. **Next day**: Restriction resets, employee can take attendance again

## Error Messages

- **Already taken**: "You have already taken attendance today. Please try again tomorrow."
- **System error**: "Error checking attendance status"
- **Firebase disabled**: Falls back to offline mode

## Testing

Use the provided test script (`test_attendance_restriction.py`) to verify:
- First attendance attempt succeeds
- Second attempt is blocked
- Appropriate error messages are returned

## Security Considerations

- Employee ID validation prevents unauthorized attendance
- Date-based restrictions ensure daily limits
- Firebase security rules should restrict attendance modifications
- Face recognition still required for all attendance attempts

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system uses existing Firebase setup and automatically creates attendance records in the `attendance` collection.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Attendance not blocking**: Check Firebase connection and collection permissions
2. **Multiple attendances**: Verify date formatting matches between frontend/backend
3. **Timer not starting**: Ensure attendance recording completes before timer initialization
4. **UI not updating**: Check error handling in attendance hook and display components
